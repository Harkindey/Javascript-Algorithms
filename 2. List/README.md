#SORRY

So the jsshell is actually stressful , i tried to put my List Properties in one file and the Use cases in another
But it does not surpport node.js's ```require``` statement.

Will need a Library to make it work, cant get one for nw.

This chanllenge is the cause for me to Comment out some part of the code , which i dont need at execution. :sob:
