Time Complexity of an algorithm signifies the total time required by the program to run to completion. 
The time complexity of algorithms is most commonly expressed using the big O notation.
Big O notation gives us an industry-standard language to discuss the performance of algorithms. 
Not knowing how to speak this language can make you stand out as an inexperienced programmer.
Did you know there are other notations that are typically used in academic settings? Learn more here.

 Big O Notation
What do we do if we have multiple expressions/loops/etc?

Complexity	Operation
O(1)		Running a statement
O(1)		Value look-up on an array, object, variable
O(logn)		Loop that cuts problem in half every iteration
O(n)		Looping through the values of an array
O(n^2)		Double nested loops
O(n^3)		Triple nested loops

Space Complexity
Given what we have discovered about time complexity, can you guess how we can calculate space complexity?

The complexity differs depending on the input data, but we tend to weigh the worst-case.
We graph the performance of our algorithms with one axis being the amount of data, 
normally denoted by 'n' and the other axis being the amount of time/space needed to execute completely.

WHAT IS THE TC?
var countChars = function(str){
    var count = 0;
    for(var i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
        count++;
    }
    return count;
};
countChars("dance");
countChars("walk");
---> I't Linear

var countChars = function(str){
    return str.length;
};
countChars("dance");
countChars("walk");
// How much more work would it take 
// to get the length of 1 million 
//char string?

---> I't 1, (.length is just a property lookup, no Operation is done to get the result)
