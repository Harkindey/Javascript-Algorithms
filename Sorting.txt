Naive Sorts

Keep looping and comparing values until the list is sorted
- Bubble Sort --> Loop through an array, comparing adjacent indices and swapping the greater value to the end
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort

Divide & Conquer Sorts

Recursively divide lists and sort smaller parts of list until entire list is sorted

- Mergesort
- Quiksort

MERGE SORT PSEUDOCODE

merge(L,R)
[3,27] [9,10] --> [3,9,10,27]


intialize empty array
compare the first index of the left array 
to the first index of the right array
push the lower value to empty array
shift the array with the lower value
repeat until both arrays are empty


mergeSort(list)
  base case: if list.length < 2, return
  break the list into halves L & R
  Lsorted = mergeSort(L)
  Rsorted = mergeSort(R)
  return merge(Lsorted, Rsorted)
