Intro To Our DS
- Stacks & Queues
- Linked Lists (how references to data works instead of having data by value)
- Hash Tables
- Arrays & Strings


Stack
    stores items in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.
Queue
    stores items in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.
Pros of Stack and Queues
    Fast operations

Stack & Queue IRL
JavaScript engines have a call stack and message queue that executes your code at runtime
When you hit 'undo' in your text editor or 'back' in your browser, you are using a stack

const stack = [1,2,3,4];
stack.push(5); 
// [1,2,3,4,5]
stack.pop();
// -> 5
// [1,2,3,4]

const queue = [1,2,3,4];
queue.enqueue(5); 
// [1,2,3,4,5]
queue.dequeue();
// -> 1
// [2,3,4,5]
